      <h2>My Personal Goals</h2>
      <p>Engineering was always an interest of mine and through combining my interest in video games and engineering design, I was able to solidify my career choice.
      Through this path of opening up and finding out my interests, choosing my major of Emerging Media Technologies made sense.
      There was a period of time where I couldn’t decide on a career choice, but through personal development, I was able to be true to myself and solidify my career/major choice.
      My future goals became clear and the steps to get there are concise.
      I plan to graduate with a Bachelor’s degree in Emerging Media Technologies and have a career in Game Design. The field is growing and getting a job after college is the plan.
      Through exploring my interests and focusing on personal development, I was able to mature and find my purpose.<p>
